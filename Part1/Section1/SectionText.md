# Overview of Cybersecurity for AI Systems
* In this section, we cover a few important questions
  * How this book came to be
  * What is it based on
  * What is in it for you, the reader

### How this book came to be
* This book started as a request from a large multinational company for
"AI and Cybersecurity" course. However - and the reader may ask the same question -
who needs whom? I mean, is AI going to help your cybersecurity stance? 
That would seem to fall under the purview of security companies, even though 
a software developer with an interest in AI might benefit from it.
* Or, should AI benefit from Cybersecurity? That would mean that someone has already built
a large collection of AI applications and was looking to protect them from hackers.
* In any case, I wrote a course for another large client of mine and immediately 18 
engineers signed up. I was up for a surprise. Even though the course was titled
"How to protect the AI systems you have build", very few of my students have actually
build something.
* This is how I understood that the book should be about everything:
  * How to build AI applications
  * How to protect them once you have build them
  * How can AI help cybersecurity.
* Accordingly, this book includes all three. First, I outline of basically what you build,
be it AI that helps you order a pizza, talk to your documents, or make your database
answer questions based on your data. You may be looking for a way to productize the AI system
that you have build and scale it. Secondly, I will show you how can the hackers attack what you have built.
Thirdly, I will show you what are the best practices protecting your systems, and
why you should not rely on your home-grown ideas but keep reading this book instead.

## **The Book Structure \- Mark’s book content is below**

This is the Packt example. Look for real stuff by Mark \- below.

To help you understand the ideal structure and pacing of a good book, we’ve created a short course to help you when plotting out your book. You can find it on our community site, here: [Outline Course](https://packt.link/Kamlu). Your contact at Packt will be able to help you get set up on our community site. The course itself is short and will aid you significantly when planning your outline.

## **Parts and Chapters** 

Packt books are normally divided into 3 or 4 parts, each consisting of 3-5 chapters. These “parts” are a group of chapters that work toward the same goal. The learning outcomes you listed previously will help to inform these. For example: A book on using IoT with AWS might be split into 3 parts: Part 1: Choose, connect, and control the right IoT device; Part 2: Route, persist, and analyze IoT data; Part 3: Commission, provision, and effectively manage IoT device fleets. Each one of these parts covers a number of chapters, as you’ll see in the next section. 

## **Chapter Outline**

Each chapter should have a clear focus. Each chapter title should clearly state what aspect of the overall topic the chapter deals with. Continuing the example above your section on choosing the right IoT device might be broken down into 4 chapters as follows: “Connecting and Controlling Devices for the First Time”, “How to choose the right IoT device and device software”; “Building constrained IoT devices with FreeRTOS”; “Building progressive applications with AWS IoT Greengrass”.

* [Lab repo in Packt](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Cybersecurity-for-AI-Systems)

## TODO
* Outline to include the new plan for the book, with a build-protect pattern  
* Start with the first chapter as a candidate for early preview  
* When the first chapter is ready, get in touch with Jeremiah Grossman, RSnake, and Kim Zetter.
* Describe each chapter on open source hacking projects [Mark]
* Add more / new conditions (roles, IT security, ...), cases (where, when, ...) … for the key risks, threats, … to AI models (GPT vs. Anthropic ...). [Brian]
  * That is related to threat modeling, which should be introduced early on
  * Add the conditions, time (Month, Year ...) when the attacks were conducted, because many attacks are not effective now.
